1 - \textbf{Select the key}\\ 
Begin with the second element (at index 1) as the \textit{key}.\\[1pt]
2 - \textbf{Compare and Shift}\\ 
Compare the key with elements in the sorted section (to its left).\\[1pt]
3 - \textbf{Shift Elements}\\ 
If an element is greater than the key, shift that element one position to the right.

4 - \textbf{Insert the Key}\\
Once an element less than or equal to the key is found (or you reach the start), insert the key immediately after that element.\\
5 - \textbf{Repeat}\\ 
Move forward to the next element, treating it as the new key, and repeat until the array is sorted.\\
\textit{Time Complexity:} Worst-case $O(n^2)$, Best-case $O(n)$.\\
